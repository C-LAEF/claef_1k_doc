## Background

This diagnostics has been developed at GeoSphere Austria by Wastl and Wittmann (ww) to improve 2m forecasts of AROME in complex terrain such as the Alps. The idea was to take the 5 different canopy levels (switched on operationally at that moment of the development of ww diagnostics in 2020) and modify the height of the screening level accordingly (in default it is the second canopy level which is at 2m). Verification has shown that the performance of this standard canopy diagnostics is strongly depending on the region. Therefore, to differ between valley and mountains, the IFAC has been introduced into PGD. It is a number between -1 (valley) and +1 (mountain), 0 indicates flatland. The idea was to lower the screening level in Alpine valleys and to increase it on the mountain peaks. Since this is not sufficient in clear sky nights in the Alpine valleys, an additional trimming towards surface temperature has been introduced. In case of extreme events (heat waves, extreme cold spells) a so called „joker“ to directly modify the temperature output has also been installed.
With the upgrade of C-LAEF to 1k in 2024, the ww diagnostics has been extended to a usage without canopy scheme. In this case the screening level height (default is 2m for temperature and humidity) is adapted.
